# socialmediamobile

A text-based React Native mobile social media app. This app has a web counterpart accesibile at [itaylor24.pythonanywhere.com.](https://itaylor24.pythonanywhere.com)
It also shares the Django REST Framework api at the same location. 

Users can create an account with a password, username, and displayname. They can then use this account to text their opinions globally and follow other users they discover on the global discover page. A users feed is tailored to the accounts they follow, and a user's messages appear on their profile.

This app uses React Navigation and React Native Paper libraries to handle its design and theming. React Navigation is also used to create a 
familiar navigation experience similar to other social media apps.
